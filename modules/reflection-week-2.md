# Week 2: Reflection

## Learning Objectives

- Practice sharing vulnerability with the people in your cohort
- Identify your biggest fear
- Describe what you would tell your friend if they shared a fear with you.

### Reflect your activities

When writing your reflection, write it for an audience. Tell a story of what you tried and what you learned. It will make it easier for you to go back and re-teach yourself or know what you were thinking.

Remember, your reflections aren't just for teachers, they are for your fellow cohort mates as well, so be generous! You could end up helping a fellow student learn something new.

Answer the following questions (in addition to the challenge-specific questions) in your reflection:

* What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?
* What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the learning objectives?
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

### Reviewing others' reflections

Komentari....
When you are commenting, try to look at and address the following:

- Did you learn something from their reflections?
- Did anything resonate with you?
- Did they run into a problem you could help with?
- Are their any concepts you are confused about as well?
- Were you able to follow their logic?
- Do you agree or disagree with their assessment? Be sure to be kind, specific, and actionable with this feedback.

**What scares you the most about being at Hacktiv8?**

Write an email to your cohort (using the cohort mailing list your welcome email was sent to) that answers this question. Use the subject "Cultural Assignment" if you are the first person.
If you are the second or later, be sure to **REPLY ALL** with your response. Be sure to do this by **Wednesday**.

* **What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0?**

	Finding time to complete all the tasks due before the deadline. I am balancing multiple things at the same time. Once in a while my baby will start crying and force me to attend to her first.

* **How will you combat that?**

	Right now I am dividing each section I want to complete in my Google Calendar. I have also dedicated a lot of time to implementing the pomodoro technique although I do mine in 27/3 instead of the typical 25/5. For each section I have 2 hours alloted, or 4 pomodoro sessions.

* **What techniques will you try?**

	Pomodoro 27/3. Another strategy that really works for me is having the computer read articles for me while I also read the article. The method really helps me digest the content because it forces my senses to focus and also because the speed of the voice can be controlled and slowed down to prevent me from reading too fast and missing the points of the article. It's really surprising how much speech technology has come along.

* **What is your overall plan for Phase 0?**

	I want to make sure I complete everything, go through all the optional sections as well.
