- Evaluate whether your actions produced positive or negative reactions

## Release 0:

First, create a new HTML file for your this post in your [USERNAME].github.io website. Create a new HTML file and use the date to name it `week4_cultural_blog.html`. Copy the Code from your `blog_template`.

## Release 1:

Remember the [compass of shame](http://southdown.on.ca/publications/articles/Compass-of-Shame.pdf)? Oftentimes when we have a conflict with someone we use one of our strategies for dealing with shame.

Conduct some research on strategies for identifying the sources for conflict then discuss a time you had a conflict in your life. Identify the reason you had the conflict and whether your actions made it better or worse.

Once you've opened your file, write a response to each exercise using the HTML you've learned to set up the file:

1. Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?
2. What was the source of the conflict?
3. How did you handle that conflict?
4. Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?
5. If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?
6. What did you learn from this experience?

* **What did you learn about design and user experience? **

	CSS is really fun! Responsive design is helpful for bringing content down to multiple smaller screen sizes.

* **Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)**

	I spent 9 hours (about 18 pomodoros) re-designing my index.html page. I cant wait to show people. I didnt like building the wireframe first, however i know that is necissary. I spend about 30 minutes making the wireframe and 8.5 hours designing the html+css to get it to where I want it.

* **What was your process? What worked and didn't work?**

	I started with a design philosophy. My design goal was "simple and accessible but rich in detail". After quickly building a wireframe, I fired up chrome, sublime text, and the developer tools. Having a second monitor really helped me with this assignment. I would build on sublime, hit save and refresh the browser to see how it reflected. I went into chrome dev tools and fine tuned things like paddings, font sizes and margins, then proceded to make the edits in sublime and save.

* **What would you like to add or change about the site next?**

	I want to have a consistency of my website, like the sidebar navigation. I want to figure out how I can edit one file and have it reflect on all subsequent pages. I also had too much fun designing the desktop version that I didnt have time to design the mobile/responsive site. I want to do those next.

* **Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?**

	The internet has every resource you're thinking about and everything you havent thought of. I added social icons on my website and wanted the colors to reflect each social network site. I wonder if they have a website that has the hex color of every social networking site. BAM! IT EXISTS! I was surprised!

	* [Hex and RGB Colors of the Web](http://designpieces.com/2012/12/social-media-colours-hex-and-rgb/)

	I also realized that a lot of icons on the internet are re-used! I used font-awesome to get all my icons as vector fonts.

* **Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.**
