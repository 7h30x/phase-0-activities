# Reflect Your Week

## Guidelines

When writing your reflection, write it for an audience. Tell a story of what you tried and what you learned. It will make it easier for you to go back and re-teach yourself or know what you were thinking.

Remember, your reflections aren't just for teachers, they are for your fellow cohort mates as well, so be generous! You could end up helping a fellow student learn something new.

Answer the following questions (in addition to the challenge-specific questions) in your reflection:

* What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?
* What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the learning objectives?
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

## Directions

* **What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?**

	It's important for the web to have standards. I remember when we didnt have propper standards and browsers were picky. I've built those websites with a button that says "Built for Netscape". Browser wars cause everyone made their own standard.

* **Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?**

	Yes, because we now live in a world with multiple browsers, everything form the computer, do phones, to televisions, fridge and possibly watches next! There has to be a standardized version of html because chrome wont be on your fridge!

* **Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?**

	Yes, this makes typing out the CSS much easier. I never remember if things are supposed to be IDs or Classes, Spans or Divs. But this makes things easier.

* ** What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different
browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?**

	I've used them all. But lately after ditching my iPhone I'm exclusively on chrome. It's bad if they dont render as the designer wanted. I want to stick with a browser that is compliant with the standards as close as possible.

* **What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?**

	Definitely good practice! I really love how websites can adopt to different sizes of gadgets that I own.

* **How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?**

	I think the screen size will soon be irrelevant. Pixels are getting smaller but that only contributes to higher DPI screens. I think we will be looking at more screens in more places. We need to build a standardized way for people to be able to consume their content in low-brightness screens. I feel that every website these days have a white background and black text as a defacto standard. Why cant it be the other way around and put less strain on our eyes.

* **How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?**

	This week I have been reading all the assignments on Phase 0 required readings through Siri. Speech technology has really caught on and I think if we make the propper tags to acomodate this, it will be fantastic. I also think a global css color flip would be a good idea, to reduce eye strains.

* **What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?**

	I've been having a hard time to convert my own websites into responsive. I think I need to dive in deeper into CSS. Everything makes sense to me, however, I dont know the right combination of CSS to get me to the desired outcome.
