# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* **Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?**

	A DOM is like a collection of strings and elements. HTML is a DOM and the computer processes the  DOM into memory.

* **How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?**

	A wordpress.com site is generated through various php scripts. It's very resource heavy and messy (IMO). The javascripts are loaded through multiple sources. Compared to my tiny github io page, its very much static and has a single css file. I did add an iframe to get comments and that makes my static site feel non-static.

* **Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?**

	It was really fun to work with. I wish there was a way to directly integrate this with sublime text.

* **Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?**

	The Pagespeed plugin for chrome is awesome for being able to give recomendations on what to do.

* **Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.**
